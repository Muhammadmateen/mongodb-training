Using $length array Operator, we can find documents with arrays with the number of elements specified.

ans: 
Nope. Its $size array Operator. More detailsi at https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/size/#op._S_size

$all Array Operator is similar to $or operation .Selects all documents where the array has even a single element matching the values passed in the $all operator.

No, Its the opposite way. Its like $and operation. Selects complete matching. Visit https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/all/ for more info on this.

$elemMatch operator supports  multiple queries,so documents with array fields, with atleast one element matching the specified Queries will be returned.
